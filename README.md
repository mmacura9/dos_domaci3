# dos_domaci3
In the folder domaci3_18_261 are two py files for two different problems. File zad1.py is program for determaining the time from the image of the clock, and zad2.py is program for classifying coins of 1 dinar and 5 dinars.
The folder sekvence contains images of coins and clocks which I used for these two projects.
